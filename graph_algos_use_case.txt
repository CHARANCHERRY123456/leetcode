1. BFS (Breadth-First Search)
  When:
  
    Find shortest path in unweighted graphs
    
    Level-order traversal
    
    Finding minimum moves (e.g., word ladder, number transformations)
    
    Graphs with few levels (shallow depth)
  
  Why:
  
    Guarantees shortest path by exploring all neighbors first
    
    Time: O(V + E)
  
  Examples:
  
    Minimum steps to convert word A to B
    
    Minimum jumps to reach end
    
    Maze shortest path (unweighted grid)
    
    Checking bipartiteness
