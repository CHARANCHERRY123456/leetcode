GRPAHS : 
  1) some times nodes are not directly given you have to identify nodes and edges by yourself
    -> first think of transitions you must have to see transitions if you can't see then it must tend to a non graph problem
    -> if tranistion then you can easily find the nodes based on transitions
    -> after idenitfying nodes and transitions some times you can build graph or sometimes without building graph also you can get adkjaceny list from transitions
