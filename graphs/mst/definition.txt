MST : minimum spanning tree 

Spanning Tree is the tree like sub graph who have the properties
    1) same no of vertices of original graph
    2) no of edges E = V - 1
    3) connected
    4) asynclic
    5) total cost/weight = sum(weights of all edges)
    6) many possible spanning trees are possible

Minimum Spanning Tree :
    among all possible spanning tree the trees with min cost is considered
    mst. and there can be many msts

How to find MST of a graph : 

1) Krushkal : (greedy , DUS)
        - sort all edges and add one by one also check adding edges can't form the cycle in st
        - implmented with Disjoint union set
        
2) Prims : (greedy , heap)
        - greedy with heap and arr or any ds to store the mst
        - consider any one vertex at the beginig in the mst
        - add the vertices so that it should be less weight 
            and it should form a edge with existing vertex and non existing(new) vertex
        - this process continued until all vertices are added
