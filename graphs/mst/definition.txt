MST : minimum spanning tree 

Spanning Tree is the tree like sub graph who have the properties
    1) same no of vertices of original graph
    2) no of edges E = V - 1
    3) connected
    4) asynclic
    5) total cost/weight = sum(weights of all edges)
    6) many possible spanning trees are possible

Minimum Spanning Tree :
    among all possible spanning tree the trees with min cost is considered
    mst. and there can be many msts
